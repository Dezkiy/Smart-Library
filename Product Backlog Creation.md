### 2. Product Backlog Creation

 Here's a prioritized product backlog using MOSCOW prioritization and including effort estimates:

 | Story ID | User Story | Priority (MOSCOW) | Effort Estimate | Dependencies |
 | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------- | :----------- |
 | US-001 | As a Library Member, I want to search for resources by title, author, or ISBN, so that I can quickly find relevant materials. | Must-have | 3 | None |
 | US-002 | As a Librarian, I want to catalog new resources with details (title, author, ISBN, etc.), so that the library catalog is up-to-date. | Must-have | 5 | None |
 | US-003 | As a Library Member, I want to borrow available resources, so that I can access the materials I need. | Must-have | 3 | US-001 |
 | US-004 | As a Library Member, I want to return borrowed resources, so that I can avoid overdue fines and make the resources available to others. | Must-have | 2 | US-003 |
 | US-006 | As a Librarian, I want to manage member accounts (create, update, deactivate), so that member information is accurate and secure. | Must-have | 5 | None |
 | US-010 | As a System Administrator, I want user data to be encrypted with AES-256, so that security compliance is met. | Must-have | 3 | None |
 | US-005 | As a Library Member, I want to reserve resources that are currently unavailable, so that I can get them when they become available. | Should-have | 3 | US-001 |
 | US-007 | As a Digital Content Provider, I want to supply e-books, so that library members have access to a wider range of resources. | Should-have | 5 | US-002 |
 | US-008 | As a Librarian, I want to generate reports on resource usage and member activity, so that I can analyze trends and improve library services. | Could-have | 3 | US-002 |
 | US-009 | As a Library Member, I want to manage my account online (update details, view borrowing history), so that I can maintain my information and track my usage. | Could-have | 3 | US-006 |
 | US-011 | As a Library Member, I want to be able to make payments online, so that I can pay any fees or fines conveniently. | Could-have | 3 | US-003, US-006 |
 | US-012 | As a Librarian, I want to manage library events (schedule, promote, track attendance), so that the library can effectively engage with the community. | Won't-have | 5 | None |

 **Justification of Prioritization:**

 * **Must-have** stories are prioritized to align with stakeholder success metrics for usability and efficiency. These stories represent the core functionalities of the library system, such as searching, cataloging, borrowing, and returning resources. They are essential for the system to be functional and provide value to the users.
 * **Should-have** stories are important but not critical for the initial launch. They enhance the user experience and add value to the system, but the system can function without them. Examples include resource reservations and digital content provision.
 * **Could-have** stories are desirable but can be deferred to future iterations. They provide additional features and improvements but are not essential for the core functionality. Online account management and online payments fall into this category.
 * **Won't-have** stories are considered the least critical or not feasible for the current project scope. Event management is an example of a feature that could be considered for a later phase of development.
