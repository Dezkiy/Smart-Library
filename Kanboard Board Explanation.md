#   Kanban Board Explanation

 A **Kanban board** is a visual project management tool used to track tasks and workflows. It consists of columns representing different stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Testing, Blocked, Done), allowing teams to monitor progress efficiently.

 ##   How My Smart Library System Kanban Board Works:

 ###   1.  Visualizing Workflow:

 The board is divided into columns, each representing a stage of task progress within the Smart Library System development: 

 * **To Do:** New user stories and tasks that need to be started.
    
 * **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on by the development team (e.g., developing the search API, designing the UI).
    
 * **Testing:** Tasks that have been developed and are now undergoing quality assurance to ensure they meet acceptance criteria. 
    
 * **Blocked:** Tasks that are currently impeded or cannot progress due to dependencies (e.g., waiting for external API integration) or unresolved issues.
    
 * **Done:** Tasks that have been completed, tested, and are ready for deployment or have been deployed.

 Each task, derived from user stories in Assignment 6, is represented as a card that moves across the board as work progresses.

 ###   2.  Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP):

 To prevent bottlenecks and overloading team members, WIP limits are set for each stage. For instance:

 * Only **3 tasks** can be in the **In Progress** column at a time.
    
 * The **Testing** column has a limit of **2 tasks** to ensure thorough quality checks.
    
 * New tasks can only be added to **In Progress** once existing ones are moved to **Testing** or **Done**.

 This ensures a steady flow of work, reduces task switching, and helps the team maintain focus.

 ###   3.  Supporting Agile Principles:

 * **Continuous Delivery:** Tasks related to library features (e.g., search, borrowing) move smoothly from start to completion, enabling iterative releases. 
    
 * **Adaptability:** The board allows the team to quickly adjust priorities based on feedback or emerging needs, such as addressing critical bugs or incorporating new requirements.
    
 * **Transparency:** Everyone involved (developers, stakeholders) can see the current status of each task, promoting collaboration, accountability, and informed decision-making.

 By using a Kanban board, the Smart Library System development team can streamline workflows, improve efficiency, and maintain an optimal work pace, ultimately delivering a high-quality system that meets stakeholder needs.
