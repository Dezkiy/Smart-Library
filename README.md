# Smart Library System

## Description

The Smart Library System aims to modernize library operations by providing a comprehensive platform for managing physical and digital resources, facilitating member interactions, and offering enhanced services.

This system will enable:

* Efficient management of books, journals, and digital media.
* Streamlined member registration and borrowing processes.
* Online access to digital content and library resources.
* Automated notifications and reminders.

 ## Kanban Board Customization Choices

 The Kanban board for this project was customized to align with the specific workflow and quality assurance requirements of the Smart Library System. The following columns were added to the base template:

 * **To Do:** This column represents the initial stage of tasks that are ready for development but have not yet been started.
   
 * **In Progress:** This column tracks tasks that are currently being worked on by the development team.
   
 * **Testing:** This column was added to explicitly track tasks that are undergoing quality assurance. This allows the development team to visualize which tasks have been completed from a development standpoint but still require validation before deployment.
   
 * **Blocked:** This column is used to highlight tasks that are currently impeded or cannot progress due to external dependencies or unresolved issues. This provides visibility into any bottlenecks or delays in the workflow, enabling the team to address them promptly.
   
 * **Done:** This column represents the final stage of tasks that have been completed, tested, and are ready for deployment.

 These customizations enhance the board's utility by providing a more detailed view of the task lifecycle and supporting a more robust Agile development process.

## Assignment 11:

## Justification: Repository Layer Design

The repository layer is implemented using a generic `Repository` interface (`repositories/repository.py`). This approach leverages Python's typing system (specifically, `TypeVar` and `Generic`) to avoid code duplication across entity-specific repositories.  For example, instead of writing separate CRUD implementations for `Book`, `LibraryMember`, etc., we define the common operations once in the `Repository` interface and then create entity-specific interfaces (e.g., `BookRepository`) that inherit from it.  This promotes code reuse and maintainability. Each entity-specific repository interface can also define methods unique to that entity (e.g., `BookRepository`'s `find_by_title`).

- [Storage Abstraction Mechanism](./factories/Storage%20Abstraction%20Mechanism.md) - For explanation of Abstraction Mechanism choice.


## Future-Proofing: Adding New Storage Backends

### DatabaseBookRepository (SQLite)
The system is designed to easily add new storage backends in the future. As an example, we have created a stub implementation for a `DatabaseBookRepository` that will save book data to an SQLite database.

You can find the stub implementation here:
- **[DatabaseBookRepository Stub](https://github.com/Mongameli-Shasha-01/Smart-Library/blob/main/repositories/database_book_repository.py)**


### SQLite Database File
For SQLite storage, we have also provided a basic `database.db` file that can be used for storing the data. You can refer to it in the project‚Äôs database integration section:
- **[SQLite Database File](https://github.com/Mongameli-Shasha-01/Smart-Library/blob/main/data/database.db)**
