 ## Kanban Board Customization Choices

 The Kanban board for this project was customized to align with the specific workflow and quality assurance requirements of the Smart Library System. The following columns were added to the base template:

 * **To Do:** This column represents the initial stage of tasks that are ready for development but have not yet been started.
   
 * **In Progress:** This column tracks tasks that are currently being worked on by the development team.
   
 * **Testing:** This column was added to explicitly track tasks that are undergoing quality assurance. This allows the development team to visualize which tasks have been completed from a development standpoint but still require validation before deployment.
   
 * **Blocked:** This column is used to highlight tasks that are currently impeded or cannot progress due to external dependencies or unresolved issues. This provides visibility into any bottlenecks or delays in the workflow, enabling the team to address them promptly.
   
 * **Done:** This column represents the final stage of tasks that have been completed, tested, and are ready for deployment.

 These customizations enhance the board's utility by providing a more detailed view of the task lifecycle and supporting a more robust Agile development process.
