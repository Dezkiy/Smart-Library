# Programming Language and Key Design Decisions

## Programming Language: Python

The programming language chosen for this assignment is **Python**. This decision was based on several key factors:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Capabilities:** Python fully supports OOP principles, allowing for the creation of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. This paradigm is well-suited for modeling real-world entities like books, library members, and loans, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.
* **Readability and Simplicity:** Python's syntax is known for its clarity and conciseness. This makes the code easier to write, understand, and debug, which is particularly beneficial for a project involving multiple classes and their interactions.
* **Extensive Standard Library:** Python's rich standard library provides a wide range of built-in modules that can simplify various tasks, although for this core class implementation, we primarily focused on fundamental OOP features.
* **Large and Active Community:** The vast Python community provides ample resources, documentation, and support, making it easier to find solutions to potential issues and learn best practices.
* **Rapid Development:** Python's high-level nature allows for quicker development cycles, enabling a faster translation of the design into functional code.

## Key Design Decisions in Class Implementation

The design of the classes within the `src` directory was guided by the following key decisions:

### 1. Encapsulation and Information Hiding

* **Attributes:** Where appropriate, attributes were intended to be treated as private or protected (though Python's mechanism is by convention using a single or double underscore prefix, e.g., `_title` or `__isbn`). This was done to encapsulate the internal state of objects and prevent direct, uncontrolled modification from outside the class.
* **Getters and Setters (as needed):** Getter methods (e.g., `get_title()`) and setter methods (e.g., `set_title(new_title)`) were considered for controlled access and modification of attributes, allowing for potential validation or side effects within these methods. The decision to include them for every attribute was made based on whether external read or write access with potential logic was required.

### 2. Modeling Real-World Entities

* Each class (`Book`, `LibraryMember`, `Loan`, `Reservation`, `Payment`, `LibraryEvent`, `Registration`) was designed to closely represent the corresponding entity in a library management system. Attributes were chosen to reflect the essential properties of these entities, and methods were designed to represent their core behaviors or interactions.

### 3. Relationships Between Classes

* **Associations:** Relationships between classes, such as a `LibraryMember` being associated with multiple `Loan` objects, were implemented using appropriate data structures (e.g., a list of `Loan` objects as an attribute of the `LibraryMember` class).
* **Composition/Aggregation:** The nature of the relationships (whether one object "has-a" another exclusively or shares it) influenced how these relationships were modeled. For instance, a `Loan` object would likely have references to a specific `Book` and a `LibraryMember`.
* **Inheritance (Potential Future Extension):** While not explicitly required in the initial class implementations, the design considered the potential for future extensions using inheritance (e.g., different types of `LibraryMember` with specialized attributes or behaviors).

### 4. Method Design and Behavior

* Methods were designed to perform specific, logical operations related to the class's responsibilities. For example, the `Loan` class would have methods for `borrow_item()` and `return_item()`.
* Method signatures were designed to be clear and intuitive, taking necessary parameters and potentially returning relevant information.

### 5. Modularity and Organization

* The decision to place all class implementations within the `src` directory promotes modularity and keeps the project structure organized. This makes it easier to locate and manage the codebase as the project grows.
* The use of relative imports within the `src` package (as demonstrated in `main.py`) reinforces this modularity and allows the different classes to interact with each other in a well-defined way.

These design decisions aimed to create a robust, maintainable, and easily understandable foundation for the library management system. The object-oriented approach in Python allows for a clear mapping between the system's components and their software representations.
