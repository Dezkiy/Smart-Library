### üß† Reflection on Failing Tests in Smart Library Project

Despite setting up a comprehensive CI pipeline with GitHub Actions, some tests in the Smart Library project continue to fail. These tests primarily target the FastAPI endpoints responsible for book, member, and reservation functionalities.

#### üîç Root Cause of Failures

The errors stem from unresolved module imports like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` or issues related to route dependencies not being properly injected. These problems are likely tied to:

* Improper `PYTHONPATH` settings in the test or runtime environment.
* Missing repository or service dependencies not being mocked or initialized during tests.
* Complex application structure that depends on runtime configurations or databases not available in the CI environment.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Why Fixing It Was Not Possible (At This Stage)

While I explored several solutions, including setting the `PYTHONPATH` manually, reorganizing imports, and even modifying the test client setup, I was unable to resolve the issues due to the following constraints:

* **Time limitations** before the project submission or CI deadline.
* **Lack of mocking or dependency injection**, which is essential for testing FastAPI services in isolation.
* **Incomplete understanding** of FastAPI‚Äôs internal testing requirements for complex route services relying on repositories and databases.

#### üîö Conclusion

These test failures highlight the importance of designing modular and testable components from the beginning, especially in layered architectures involving routes, services, and repositories. Given more time and support, I would focus on implementing proper dependency injection, mocking database layers, and ensuring environment consistency across development and CI.
